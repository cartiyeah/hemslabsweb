# HEMS Labs: Startup Instructions

**CRITICAL: Every new instance MUST read the knowledge base before doing any work.**

## Step 1: Read the Knowledge Base Index
```
view_file C:\Users\vaish\.gemini\antigravity\brain\0d636cfb-2116-465f-8343-8ff4e48f3c2c\0_index.md
```

## Step 2: Read Core Knowledge Files (in order)
1. `1_identity.md` — Who is HEMS Labs, brand personality
2. `2_tech_stack.md` — Full 2026 stack (R3F, GSAP, Lenis, WebGPU)
3. `3_design_philosophy.md` — The "Diving-In" vibe, inspirations
4. `4_code_patterns.md` — Ready-to-use code snippets
5. `5_blender_mcp.md` — Blender MCP asset pipeline

## Step 3: Check Current Task
```
view_file C:\Users\vaish\.gemini\antigravity\brain\0d636cfb-2116-465f-8343-8ff4e48f3c2c\task.md
```

## Key Rules
- The user hates generic designs. Every decision must feel premium.
- Scroll = Animation. The "diving" experience is the core mechanic.
- Use Blender MCP to create custom 3D assets, not stock models (except generic geometry).
- Always update `task.md` as you complete work.
